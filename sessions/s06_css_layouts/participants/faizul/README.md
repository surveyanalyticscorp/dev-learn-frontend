# CSS Flexbox Layout Practice

This exercise provides a series of progressively challenging tasks to help you master CSS Flexbox layouts. The tasks range from simple element centering to complex responsive Holy Grail layouts with dynamic content.

## Learning Objectives

By completing these tasks, you'll learn:

1. How to use Flexbox properties effectively
2. How to create responsive layouts using Flexbox
3. How to center elements both horizontally and vertically
4. How to create navigation bars, card layouts, and galleries
5. How to implement complex layouts with headers, footers, and sidebars
6. How to handle dynamic content in a flex layout

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1 – Center the Box

Learn how to perfectly center an element both horizontally and vertically within a container using Flexbox.

### Task 2 – Create a Navigation Bar

Implement a common navigation bar pattern with a logo on the left and navigation links on the right.

### Task 3 – Equal Height Cards

Create a row of cards that maintain equal heights regardless of their content.

### Task 4 – Photo Gallery

Build a responsive photo gallery that wraps items as needed and maintains proper spacing.

### Task 5 – Responsive Dashboard Layout

Create a dashboard with a sidebar and main content area that stacks on smaller screens.

### Task 6 – Holy Grail Layout with Dynamic Content

Implement the classic "Holy Grail" layout with header, footer, main content area, and two sidebars. This advanced task includes handling dynamic content and responsive behavior.

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in your browser to see the tasks.
2. The `task.css` file contains comments with instructions and empty CSS rules for you to complete.
3. Use ONLY Flexbox properties to solve these challenges (no grid or absolute positioning).
4. Test your layouts at different screen sizes to ensure they're responsive.
5. Once you've completed all tasks, you can compare your solutions with the reference implementation.

## Task 6 Highlights

The Holy Grail layout is particularly challenging and demonstrates real-world application of Flexbox:

- Header with dynamic title that updates in real-time
- Three-column layout that stacks responsively on mobile
- Main content area that properly handles overflow with custom scrollbars
- Interactive elements that add content dynamically without breaking the layout

## Tips for Success

1. Start with the simpler tasks to build your understanding of Flexbox concepts.
2. Use your browser's developer tools to inspect elements and modify styles in real-time.
3. Remember that Flexbox operates on two axes - main axis and cross axis.
4. For responsive layouts, combine Flexbox with media queries.
5. Test your solutions at different screen sizes.

Happy coding!
