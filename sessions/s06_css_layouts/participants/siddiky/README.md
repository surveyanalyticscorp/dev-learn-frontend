## Completed Tasks

### Task 1 – Center the Box

Centered a box element both horizontally and vertically using flexbox alignment properties.

### Task 2 – Create a Navigation Bar

Built a navigation bar with a logo positioned on the left and navigation links on the right with proper spacing.

### Task 3 – Equal Height Cards

Created a row of cards that maintain equal heights regardless of their content length.

### Task 4 – Photo Gallery

Implemented a responsive photo gallery that wraps items dynamically and maintains consistent spacing.

### Task 5 – Responsive Dashboard Layout

Developed a dashboard layout with a fixed-width sidebar and flexible main content area that stacks vertically on smaller screens.

### Task 6 – Holy Grail Layout with Dynamic Content

Constructed a classic Holy Grail layout featuring:

- Header with dynamic title that updates in real-time
- Three-column layout with navigation, main content, and sidebar
- Scrollable main content area with custom scrollbar styling
- Fully responsive design that stacks columns on mobile devices
- Interactive elements for adding dynamic content

## Key Flexbox Concepts Applied

- Using `display: flex` to create flex containers
- Centering elements with `align-items` and `justify-content`
- Creating flexible layouts with `flex` and `flex-shrink`
- Managing spacing with `gap` property
- Wrapping elements with `flex-wrap`
- Changing layout direction with `flex-direction`
- Implementing responsive designs with media queries
- Handling overflow content with proper scrolling

## Implementation Details

All tasks were completed using only flexbox properties without relying on grid or absolute positioning. The solutions are optimized for performance and maintainability with clean, semantic CSS.
